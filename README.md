# No Escape!

### This mod is intended to be used for IRL events where users should not be able to switch worlds or close Minecraft.
### It can also be used for trolling, but please don't try using it in malicious ways.

This mod prevents the user from:
 - opening the escape menu (and thus, from switching worlds or changing settings)
 - exiting Fullscreen (either from settings or using F11)
 - closing Minecraft (using alt + f4 or the button in the main menu)
 - switching to a different window (i.e. using alt + tab)

There is a hotkey to bypass all mentioned limitations: left alt + right shift.
While holding these two keys, You can open the escape menu or exit minecraft.
